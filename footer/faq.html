        <summary>Why are pride flags and labels important?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Pride flags and labels can help 2SLGBTQIA+ people feel validated, supported, and proud of who they
                are.</li>
            <li>They help promote visibility and inclusivity, signal safe spaces, and can help queer people feel less
                isolated by fostering connection to people with similar experiences.</li>
            <li>For more information on the importance of labels and people's experiences with them,

        <summary id="umbrella-term">What are umbrella terms?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Umbrella terms are broad labels that serve as a category for other identities to fall under.</li>
            <li>People can identify with only the umbrella term (like bisexual or transgender), only the microlabel
                (see next question for definition), or both/multiple.
            </li>

        <details>
        <summary>What are microlabels and why do they matter?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Microlabels refer to specific terms that fall under a broader umbrella term or spectrum, such as
                demisexual, which falls under the asexual umbrella.</li>
            <li>Since they are more specific, they help people identify personal experiences that might not
                necessarily be included within the umbrella term.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer to use microlabels without identifying with the corresponding umbrella term 
                because they feel it represents them better.</li>
            <li>For more information, <a href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Microlabel">visit the LGBTQIA+ Fandom

        <summary id="fluid">How are identities fluid?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Many people experience some form of identity fluidity, meaning their identity fluctuates over time.</li>
            <li>The same is true for queer people, which can manifest in using different labels over time, changing
                pronouns and/or gender expression, and many other ways.</li>
            <li>In fact, there are specific labels for people who experience fluctuating identities, such as
                genderfluid and abrosexual.</li>
