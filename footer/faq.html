            <summary>Why are pride flags and labels important?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Pride flags and labels can help 2SLGBTQIA+ people feel validated, supported, and proud of who
                    they are.</li>
                <li>They help promote visibility and inclusivity, signal safe spaces, and can help queer people feel
                    less isolated by fostering connection to people with similar experiences.</li>
                <li>For more information on the importance of labels and people's experiences with them,

            <summary id="umbrella-term">What are umbrella terms?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Umbrella terms are broad labels that serve as a category for other identities to fall under.</li>
                <li>People can identify with only the umbrella term (like bisexual or transgender), only the
                    <a href="./faq.html#microlabel">microlabel</a>, or both/multiple.</li>

            <summary id="microlabel">What are microlabels and why do they matter?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Microlabels refer to specific terms that fall under a broader umbrella term or spectrum, such as
                    demisexual, which falls under the asexual umbrella.</li>
                <li>Since they are more specific, they help people identify personal experiences that might not
                    necessarily be included within the umbrella term.</li>
                <li>Some people prefer to use microlabels without identifying with the corresponding umbrella term 
                    because they feel it represents them better.</li>

            <summary id="fluid">How are identities fluid?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Many people experience some form of identity fluidity, meaning their identity fluctuates over
                    time.</li>
                <li>The same is true for queer people, which can manifest in using different labels over time,
                    changing pronouns and/or gender expression, and many other ways.</li>
                <li>In fact, there are specific labels for people who experience fluctuating identities, such as
                    genderfluid and abrosexual.</li>
                <li>To learn more about how identities can be fluid,

            <summary id="pronouns">Do pronouns correspond to gender?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>No, pronouns do not equate or correspond to gender.</li>
                <li>People often assume that she/her are the pronouns that women use and he/him are the pronouns
                    that men use, but this is only because of societal expectations.</li>
                <li>In reality, people can use any pronouns they like or no pronouns, no matter what gender they are.</li>
                <li>Some people use combinations of pronouns, like they/she, it/they, or he/she/they, while others
                    stick to one set of pronouns like she/her or xe/xem.</li>

        <details>
            <summary id="spectrum">What is a spectrum?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>A spectrum literally means the composition of colors based on individual components of colors,
                    with each unique color contributing to the overall vision of the spectrum. This same meaning
                    can be applied in how we think about gender and/or sexual identity as being on a spectrum.</li>
                <li>This spectrum does not have two binary sides; rather, think of a spectrum like a universe:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each of us carries and holds many different identities; in thinking about queerness, the
                            spectrum can be like a universe.</li>
                        <li>We find commonality in some identities/labels and group those
                            together (galaxies), and there are also some identities that do not neatly fit into
                            other galaxies (constellations).</li>
                        <li>And then there are individuals (stars) just trying to figure things
                            out who aren't sure if they should be in this galaxy or constellation but know they are
                            part of the ever-changing universe.</li>
                        <li>And we know that our universe is always growing, just like our
                            understanding of queerness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <summary>What is the history behind Pride?</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>Pride is resistance. The first official Pride event took place in 1970 in NYC and was honoring
                    the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Uprisings and the newly formed Gay Liberation Movement.</li>
                <li>Over the years, Pride has shifted and taken many different forms with resistance at its core.</li>
                <li>Pride represents power, joy, pain, triumph, and so much more!</li>
