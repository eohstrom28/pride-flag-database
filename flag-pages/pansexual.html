            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities
                are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Pansexual (often shortened to "pan") is a term used by people attracted to multiple genders,
                attracted to all genders, and/or attracted to people regardless of gender ("gender-blind").
                Pansexual people may or may not experience other forms of attraction and can be any gender; the term
                simply refers to a person's sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>Some pansexual people also identify as bisexual and/or use another label to describe their 
                sexuality, while others only use pansexual. Often, bisexual and pansexual are confused with one
                another. The distinctions between the two terms are frequently debated, so each person may define
                them differently. Ultimately, a person who experiences attraction to multiple genders chooses which
                label(s) to use based upon their personal preference.</p>
            
            <p>The following quote is from Anna (she/her), President of SPEAK at Lehigh University, who is
                pansexual:</p>
            <p>“At this point in understanding myself, I feel most comfortable with the label of pansexual. To me,
                pansexuality means being attracted to people regardless of their gender. The interest is not so much
                about what gender a certain person is, but more about who they are as a person and how we connect
                with one another. This identity feels flexible because it decenters gender as the primary reason for
                attraction, and makes the focus a person's characteristics simply as a human being.”</p>
