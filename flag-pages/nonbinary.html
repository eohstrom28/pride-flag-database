            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a label
                without exactly matching the definition because <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities are
                fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Nonbinary (also spelled non-binary, often shortened to "enby") is a term used by people who 
                fall outside of the gender binary, meaning they are not strictly male or female. Nonbinary only
                refers to a person's gender, so nonbinary people can be any sexuality or romantic orientation.
                Nonbinary people can use any pronouns they like or no pronouns, since
                <a href="../footer/faq.html#pronouns">pronouns don't equate gender.</a> Nonbinary people can present
                in any way they like; they do not have to present in an androgynous way to be nonbinary.</p>

            <p>Some nonbinary people also identify as transgender, genderqueer, or another label, while others
                only use nonbinary to describe their gender. As such, some nonbinary people feel in between male and
                female, some feel gender-neutral, some identify with multiple genders, some have a gender identity
                that varies over time, and some identify as a third gender (which can be culturally-specific or not).
            </p>

            <p>The following quote is from Rooster (they/them), a behavioral health technician who identifies as
                nonbinary:</p>
            <p>“Labels are so annoying. Humans are not binary things. Height, weight, skin tone, hair color, they're
                all on a spectrum that is held down by language into binary concepts. I understand why social
                contracts are so important, but do they have to be so difficult? Why do I have to label every single
                part of me to be understood? I use pronouns and preferences to garner respect, but it's just another
                thing, like red hair or brown eyes.”</p>
