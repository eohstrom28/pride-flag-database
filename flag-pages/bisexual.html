            <p>Disclaimer: People can experience identities in different ways. As such, people can identify with a
                label without exactly matching the definition because <a href="../footer/faq.html#fluid">identities
                are fluid</a>.</p>

            <p>Bisexual (often shortened to "bi") is a term used by people who experience sexual attraction to
                multiple genders, one's own gender and at least one more gender, and/or all genders. Bisexual people
                may or may not experience other forms of attraction and can be any gender; the term only refers to
                a person's sexual orientation. Bisexual is also an <a href="../footer/faq.html#umbrella-term">
                umbrella term</a> for identities that involve attraction to multiple genders, which is sometimes
                distinguished from the label itself as bisexual+ or bi+ (see more in the
                <a href="">Related Identities</a> section).
            </p>

            <p>Some bisexual people have preferences for particular genders, some feel more strongly attracted to
                specific genders, some feel equal attraction, and some experience attraction that is not linked to 
                gender.</p>

            <p>Some bisexual people also identify as pansexual and/or use another label to describe their 
                sexuality, while others only use bisexual. Often, the terms bisexual, omnisexual, polysexual, and
                pansexual are confused with one another. The distinctions between the terms are frequently debated,
                so each person may define them differently. Ultimately, a person who experiences attraction to 
                multiple genders chooses which label(s) to use based upon their personal preference.</p>
